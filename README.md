## üìò Overview  
This repository contains several **Python projects** developed as part of a programming course at the **Universidad de Antioquia** in **2020**.  
The course had a duration of **64 hours**, during which I practiced **algorithms, data structures, user interaction, GUI programming, and financial simulations**.  

As a result of completing this course, I obtained an official **certification**, which can be found in this repository.
